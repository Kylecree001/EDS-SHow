Machine learning should have the same variables for all images, meaning no outside factors affect the learning process; instead, only the required features are being learnt. However, different image sizes cause the machine learning algorithm to add a new set of variables, reducing the accuracy and increasing the time to train.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Another reason that image resizing is necessary is a model&#39;s training and prediction time. For example, if an input image is doubled in size, the model needs to perform four times more calculations for that image, significantly increasing the training time.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The training and test set images for this project were originally 3024 x 4032 pixels (width x height). However, the model requires an input where the pixel dimension is multiples of 32. Therefore, the images were resized to 256 x 320 pixels (width x height). This resolution was selected as the values are multiples of 32, the image ratios are around the same as the originals, and the resolution still contained enough detail to detect features while being low enough that training and testing would be fast.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part17.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Dissertation%20-%20html.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part19.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
