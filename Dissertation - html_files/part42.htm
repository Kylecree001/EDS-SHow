The application would use machine learning to identify recycling and then apply a form of gamification to incentivize the user to recycle.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Creating a mobile application is useful as it gains access and ease of use to anyone with a phone. All a user would have to do is open an app and they could then use the application to identify recycling and help them make the correct choice. Another aspect of this paper that is discussed is using a gamification system of the data to make it more interactive and incentivize the users to continue to use the app.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">One aspect that will need more research from this paper is the use of designing the interface and how the data gamification would work. This plays a large part in the app as a good design would ensure that the users would stay using the app. The incentives for the application also need to be good enough that the standard user would be happy to use the app.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The major advantage of the project that has been proposed is the fact that the data is collected automatically by a computer system and therefore requires no extra work for a general household. The data could then be used by the household to make a change, and see the results.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The major advantage of this system is the number of interactions that users would have. This allows the user to associate recycling with a fun activity on the app. As well as this more data can be collected and used to determine where the gaps in knowledge about recycling are and how this knowledge can best be addressed.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part41.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Dissertation%20-%20html.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part43.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
