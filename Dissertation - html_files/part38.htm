In the past decade, more and more research has been done in the field of machine learning to deal with image recognition. More commonly now a convoluted neural network (CNN) is used to identify and classify images, this works through getting a large set of data and then training a model with the data. After training the model should be able to identify with a large degree of accuracy.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Automatic Classification Bin Based on Artificial Intelligent Technology [1] [MDA1] uses a CNN to detect different recycling and rubbish that is input to their bin design. A camera is used to capture the data in a box environment that has lighting. An input of a single piece of rubbish/recycling is used. In terms of software, this allows the images that are taken to all be in a “uniform” manner which helps reduce the amount of processing of the image that is needed. Machine vision-based design of human-machine interactive waste bins for shopping mall areas [2] has the same idea in that all the images will be taken in an environment that is the same, reducing the use of the image post-processing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Using the machine learning algorithm that has been shown has a strong base, however, one large problem does exist in the use of outliers. If the application does not get an input of a single piece of rubbish, or something that has not been seen before the classification will be incorrect. This could lead to sorting the object incorrectly or just sorting all the unknown objects as rubbish, meaning that good recycling is ending up in the landfill. A solution to this would be using a lot more data and creating a scenario where there is more than one item in the bin at a time. Doing this will allow the machine learning model to detect more than one object, allowing either mitigation or user feedback on fixing the problem.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Smart mobile robot system for rubbish collection [3] takes a different approach as this device is made to actively seek out the rubbish and therefore does not have the ability to take the data in a uniform matter. As well this design needs to have a way to navigate through the environment in which it is in and therefore needs that to be part of the way it “sees”. A CNN is still used here,</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">however, instead of using the standard image recognition a subset called RBG CNN is used. RBG uses colours on the RGB spectrum as a large part of the CNN.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Using the RBG CNN system creates the problem of using the application within different lighting conditions. As light levels can change the RGB value of the object, which would then mean incorrect classification of the object being detected. Night-time would also provide a problem as most of the colours of objects are black and therefore throwing the RBG values out and creating an incorrect classification of an object. Therefore, this idea is only going to correctly classify the rubbish/recycling in certain light levels, and therefore would be needing to be applied in a place such as a mall that has constant artificial light levels.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part37.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Dissertation%20-%20html.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part39.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
