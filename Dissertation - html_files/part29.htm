With this idea in full usage, it would significantly affect the environment and the economy.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Economically, by decreasing the amount of recycling in the landfill, there would be more recycled products such as aluminium, paper and cardboard. This subsequent increase in materials would significantly affect all areas and industries that use these materials frequently. An example could be shipping companies, which use many boxes made from cardboard. With an influx of recycled materials, the shipping companies in this example would have more options on how to source their cardboard, and therefore with more competition in the market, pricing would change. This effect would go for all the recycled materials in higher abundance if they could be processed instead of ending up in the landfill.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">As well as more materials and subsequently more competition for prices, there would also be the economic effect of more recycling plants. As with more recycling, there would need to be more</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">extensive infrastructure to deal with the extra recycling material. This would create more jobs and factories to process these products.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Environmentally the effects of a successful version of this project would be enormous. Recycling reduces the effect of pollution at two different points; the first is that more recycling leads to fewer raw materials that need to be collected. This reduces the pollution and cost associated with extracting raw materials from the Earth. Secondly, with recycled materials, there is less waste to dispose of, and subsequently, fewer landfills and pollution from disposals. Finally, recycling increases the life cycle of raw materials as there are multiple cycles for the material.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part28.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Dissertation%20-%20html.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part30.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
