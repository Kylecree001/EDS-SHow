This highlights that there are a lot of different ways that data could be used to help further reduce the amount of contamination in recycling.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Data collected from a bin design could be used to help in many different areas. Machine learning requires a large dataset to be able to effectively train a model, therefore the more data that is collected the more training that could be done, increasing the accuracy of the model. This increase in the data could also help with aspects such as rare cases e.g. a differently branded box, something that does not have much data, increasing further the amount of correct classification. As well as stated, there is a practical problem such as putting more than one item of rubbish in the bin at a time, and with more data, these events could be recognized better and allow for some form of mitigation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Another large use for the data would be to allow the public access to the data and allow the data to be used to educate the public. There is a large number of people that classify recycling incorrectly and therefore cause the contamination by accident. As well as educating the public you could also see what companies produce a lot of waste that is non-recyclable and use the data to help the company move to more sustainable packaging. Furthermore, the data could be collected and used by branches of the government to ensure that recycling is kept to a minimum level, if not the data could be used to help recognize what needs to be done to help and what incentives would work to get people to correctly classify their recycling.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Overall, the papers represent good starting points on ways to reduce the amount of contamination within recycling. However, the data collected from these projects should be used to help further both the image recognition quality as well as to educate the public on what they are recycling wrong. More research done for the use of data could have a larger effect than any of the designs presented above.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part40.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Dissertation%20-%20html.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part42.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
