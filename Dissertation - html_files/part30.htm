For future applications of this idea, there are several areas I would change.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The collection and usage of images were one of the areas that struggled the most within this project. After trying for months, the initial images could not be collected from a recycling truck during a pickup run. Using these images would have helped significantly, as when creating the model, it would have been able to use real-world data and have both the training and test data in the same format. These images would have the most profound effect on the project, producing a much better model with a high enough accuracy to be used in the real world.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The other aspect of this project that would be recommended to explore further is how the predictions of a sufficiently accurate model would be used. Examples are how can the data educate the public? Are there other ways to tag the bins with contamination and warn the owner? Is there a way to separate the contaminated recycling from the rest at the time of detection?</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part29.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Dissertation%20-%20html.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part31.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
