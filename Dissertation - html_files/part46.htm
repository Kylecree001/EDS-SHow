The research shows that there is a strong ability to create a machine learning model that can be used to identify contamination in recycling. The technique used throughout the review highlight the need to create a system that can detect and classify multiple different recycling and rubbish aspects in one picture.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The biggest problem with most of the designs in the review is the need to create and manage tools, such as the bin which could be very expensive and require a change to infrastructure for waste management. The other idea such as robots has large drawbacks as well, being that a lot of them require certain light conditions to work.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The project that was proposed will attempt to fix these problems by attaching the needed machine learning equipment to the truck that collects the material. This will allow the infrastructure that is already in place to still be useful. The data from machine learning will then be able to be used in many different ways to help reduce the contamination.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Research methods going forward are going to focus on two main areas. First is collecting the data that is needed to train a model for the task. The second will be using that model to accurately detect the contamination and then taking that data of what is causing the problems and using it in a useful way. This could be to gamify the data, as well as identify general holes in knowledge around recycling and find a path to fix them.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part45.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Dissertation%20-%20html.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part47.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
