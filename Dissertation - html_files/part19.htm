Within the training process, the model will attempt a path through the model and then compare the results to the labelled values, which are then used to change the weights and biases for the next training run. Within the test process, the labels are used after the models have made a prediction to compare to and gain the accuracy values.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The data used in this project was set into six different categories, cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic and trash. This meant that there were six different labels, one for each category.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The ADAMS [42] annotator tool was used. Within the ADAMS annotator tool [42], the flow called adams-imaging-image_segmentation_annotation was utilised. This tool allows the user to select the image directory, a file format for output, the labels wanted, whether or not to use an implicit background, the annotation type, and the max undo steps. For this project, the most critical settings were the file format output, which needed to be the blue channel format, which the model uses. In addition, the labels of cardboard, glass, paper, plastic, metal and trash were used, as well as no implicit background and the allowance of multiple annotations per pixel used. Once set up, the images to be labelled were selected and opened one by one. The correct label was selected within each image, and then the pixels that use that label were outlined and filled in, as shown in figure 3.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Within the test set of images, this process was a lot easier as there was only one label per image. However, as shown in figure 4, the test set mirrored the real world; many different labels occur multiple times within a single image.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="602" height="405" alt="image" src="Image_003.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Figure 3: ADAMS labelled train data example</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="602" height="403" alt="image" src="Image_004.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figure 4: ADAMS labelled test data example</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part18.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Dissertation%20-%20html.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part20.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
