It is estimated that up to 72% of New Zealand recycling [40] ends up in landfills. The reason for this is that when recycling has waste, the whole lot needs to be thrown out as currently there is no way to separate the two types of materials. If there is any rubbish that contaminates the recycling, it cannot be processed and therefore ends up in the landfill. Currently, the environment is an essential topic with many different aspects as the human race tries to decrease the damage we cause to the planet. Recycling is a process that can and does have an enormous impact on the environment. The recycling process reduces carbon emissions at two critical stages in most product life cycles; the first is that with more recycling, there is less need to extract new raw material from the Earth. Reducing material extraction reduces pollution caused by the extraction while requiring less raw material to be mined due to the recycled material supply. Secondly, the recycling process affects the end of life of many products. Instead of being thrown away and ending up in a landfill, the product can be recycled and reused multiple times, greatly extending recyclable materials&#39; use and life cycle.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Although recycling&#39;s most significant effect would be on the environment, several other effects occur within human society. Economically, recycling changes the supply and demand for a lot of different materials in the world. If we take an example in New Zealand, we could use the plastic bags that used to be used throughout most stores which have now been changed to paper bags. Although plastic bags would last longer, paper bags can be recycled once used and, therefore, have a longer useful life cycle. Economically, this change meant that plastic bags were no longer in demand; at the same time, paper bags were in higher demand. Hence, supply and demand change, and subsequently, this economic effect would be applied to anything recyclable, such as different metals.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">This project&#39;s main requirements are to produce a machine-learning model that could be used to identify rubbish contamination within recycling. The model would ideally be deployed in the back of recycling trucks as they do their recycling runs. Adding in the detection at this step ensures that the current infrastructure and procedures in place for recycling collection are not disrupted and, therefore, are more attractive for widespread adoption. For this project, the main focus is on the machine learning model and its usability of the model; subsequent papers could explore how to use the data from this model to either improve the model or integrate the model further into the recycling process for better effect.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Throughout this dissertation, many chapters explain the idea further, the process, results, evaluation and conclusions. First, a review of the research and development that has previously been done on and around this topic is carried out. Next, one of the essential parts, the data collection, the backbone of this project, is discussed. Implementation is the next topic, detailing how the model was created, what processes were used and how the scores were obtained. Results and evaluation is the next chapter, showing the results, the values, and the reasons for those results. Finally, the conclusion here is a general statement about the project and its outcome, how the project would impact the wider world and future recommendations.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part9.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Dissertation%20-%20html.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part11.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
