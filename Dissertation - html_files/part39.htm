Automatic Classification Bin Based on Artificial Intelligent Technology [1] and Machine vision-based design of human-machine interactive waste bins for shopping mall areas [2]. These papers implement machine learning to assist with a bin design. The idea is the user would throw away an item, as usual, the machine learning would then classify the item and place it in the correct section. Smart mobile robot system for rubbish collection [3] presents a different approach, using a robot that actively seeks out the rubbish/recycling on the ground, retrieves the item, and then places it in the correct bin based on its classification.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Both of these approaches have good characteristics, however, in the real world, they do have problems. The bin design would work well for something like a shopping mall, which one was designed for, however, in a household environment, practical problems would occur. Collection of rubbish/recycling is currently done with a truck that collects that bin with a mechanical arm and shakes out the recycling/rubbish from the bin. If the bin was set up like shown in the papers this would shake around all the electronics and other parts such as the camera, making the possibility of the equipment to be broken and need replacing. The other option would then be to change the way that recycling/rubbish is collected, however, this would mean a massive change in the logistics and current infrastructure of waste management.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Another large problem with the bin design is the need for maintenance and repairs. A standard bin as we have today is a plastic casing that contains the rubbish/recycling, no montane, and low cost to produce. However, modifying the bin to allow the image detection and sorting like the papers suggest would increase the production cost of the bins significantly as well as if something breaks a standard user could not fix it and therefore a need to train and manage a team of technicians would be needed. Therefore, either the components that are needed for the bin to be created would need to decrease in price significantly or someone, either the government or companies would have to take the initial economic toll of using this design.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Power source becomes another issue of the bin design. One of the designs uses a solar panel to power the system, which would solve the power problem, however, produces another problem that the device can only be used in a place with direct sunlight access. Limiting the placing of the bin provides a practical issue when meaning that sunlight must be present, a place such as an apartment complex could have a problem with this. The other solution is to use a plug that connects to a wall socket, however, this too produces problems. Most bins are located outside and therefore the use of power would require an external source from the house. As well the outside elements are not hospitable to electricity and therefore aspects such as water from rain will need to be considered, such that an electrical problem would not occur.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Another issue is with the way the system and detection are designed. The design is meant for a person to input a singular item and then have that item recognized and detected. However, a lot of houses Will have multiple smaller bins in areas like the bathroom, when a bin like this is then emptied into a bigger one that detection is not set to work with multiple items. This could lead to the items being classified incorrectly.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="407" height="347" alt="image" src="Image_032.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fig. 1: Design of Automatic Classification Bin Based on Artificial Intelligence Technology [1]</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="516" height="253" alt="image" src="Image_033.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: left;">Fig. 2: Design of <span class="p">Machine vision-based design of human-machine interactive waste bins for shopping mall areas [2]</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part38.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Dissertation%20-%20html.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part40.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
