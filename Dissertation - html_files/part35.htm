The research that has been done on this technology allows computers to interpret the world in the same way as humans, therefore allowing us to use computers to aid in many areas that previously were impossible.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">One of the largest problems within the current world is with the environment, as our society recognises the importance of keeping the environment healthy more and more research is done in the field of suitability. Recycling has been a key component of helping the environment as it reduces overall waste in both the process of extraction from the earth and means that less material ends up in the landfill. However, there is one large problem with recycling, which is the majority of recycling ends up in landfills due to contamination.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">To fix the problem it is proposed that using machine learning and the developments in computer vision, a program could be created to assist. In the past, research has been carried out in this area, such as creating a bin that sorts the items into the correct categories, a robot that detects, picks up the rubbish, and sorts it, mobile application, and bottle recycling machines. All of these ideas provide relevance in both knowing the problem has some possibility of being solved and seeing how the papers solved certain problems.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">A proposed project will look at taking images from a collection truck as the recycling is loaded into the truck. The image will be passed through a CNN model and the rubbish and recycling will be identified. Once the data is identified it will be collected and used to help prevent the rubbish through ways such as educating the public. This project requires that the approach taken will be one that can be implemented into the current system without changing much, all that changes is the collection truck will need some equipment and to be connected to a computer. Carrying out the project in this way would allow a more practical approach to the research that has already been done. Overall the goal is to reduce the amount of recycling that ends up in landfills due to contamination.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">This paper reviews current research on technology around the use of machine learning and how it can help with the current contamination levels in recycling, through the use of detection software. Data collected from this paper will form the basis of the proposed project.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part34.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Dissertation%20-%20html.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part36.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
