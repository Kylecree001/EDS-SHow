Many different approaches such as smart bins, robots, production line robots, mobile applications, and more have been researched.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Many of the research papers have been insightful into what has worked for them and what could be researched in the future to further the ideas. The majority of the research highlighted that image detection on a single object is very effective and accurate. More research into identifying different contaminants in a large amount of recycling will push the field further as it provides more uses within the current infrastructure, e.g. sorting after collection.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The main result from this literature review has been around the lack of use of data in the systems that have been designed. Therefore, as the proposed project moves forward, the focus will be on extracting useful data using the machine learning model and finding a way to make that data useful in educating or incentivizing the public.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part46.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Dissertation%20-%20html.html">Contents</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
