Within machine learning, the data must be split to ensure that the test results are accurate. If the data is not split, the test data is the same as the training data. As the model has seen that same input before, instead of predicting an output, it will produce the same output used for training, making the model appear more accurate than it actually is.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Since there are already two sets of images within this project, the training images were split into the training and validation set at 90% and 10%, while the test images were just used for testing. The validation images within this project are used to guild the training process. When each training run- through is ended, the validation data is used to check the trained model and subsequently update the weights and bias for the next run. Since both the validation and training set have been used in the training process, they are invalid for the testing, as this would produce inaccurate results.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Splitting the training and validation data was done by moving 10% of the images for each category to a different folder. Then the correct arguments were passed into the model training. The test images were left in a separate folder</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part19.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Dissertation%20-%20html.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part21.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
