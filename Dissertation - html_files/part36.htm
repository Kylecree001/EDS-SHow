Within this literature review, the data needs to be credible, and therefore most of the sources come from journals or conferences. This ensures that the data that is being reviewed has been seen by many different people and the author has taken a scientific approach to the problem that is trying to be solved.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, even though most of the reviews come from journals and conferences other data sources do need to be looked at such as commercial products. Within this search some commercial products are used for sorting recycling such as DeeTee recycling [37], however, this solution uses x-ray technology instead of the image recognition that is proposed in this project. Other projects such as Sesotec [38] exist where a commercial company is in the business of sorting.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part35.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Dissertation%20-%20html.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part37.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
