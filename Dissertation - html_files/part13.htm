For example, in the past decade, more and more research has been done in machine learning to deal with image recognition. More commonly now, a convoluted neural network (CNN) is used to identify and classify images; this works through getting a large set of data, in this case, images and then training a model with those images. After training, the model should be able to identify different features of the images with a significant degree of accuracy.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Automatic Classification Bin Based on Artificial Intelligent Technology [1] [MDA1] uses a CNN to detect different recycling and rubbish inputs to their bin design. A camera is used to capture the images in a box environment that has lighting. An input of a single piece of rubbish/recycling is used. In terms of software, this allows the images taken to all be &quot; uniform &quot;, which helps reduce the amount of image processing. Machine vision-based design of human-machine interactive waste bins for shopping mall areas [2] has the same idea in that all the images will be taken in an environment that is the same, reducing the use of image post-processing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Using the machine learning algorithm that has been shown has a strong base. However, one significant problem does exist in the use of outliers. If the application does not get input from a single item of rubbish or recycling, or an item that has not been seen before, the classification will be incorrect. This could lead to sorting the object incorrectly or just sorting all the unknown objects as rubbish, meaning that good recycling ends up in the landfill. A solution to this would be using</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">many more images to train and creating a scenario where there is more than one item in the bin at a time. Doing this will allow the machine learning model to detect more than one object, allowing either mitigation or user feedback on fixing the problem.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Smart mobile robot system for rubbish collection [3] takes a different approach as this device is made to seek out the rubbish actively and, therefore, cannot take images in a uniform matter. This design also needs to have a way to navigate the environment it is in and therefore needs that to be part of the way it &quot;sees&quot;. A CNN is still used here; however, instead of using the standard image recognition, a subset called RBG (red, green, blue) CNN is used.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Using the RBG CNN system has the problem of light levels. Light levels can change the RGB value of the object, which would then mean an incorrect classification of the object being detected. Night- time would also provide a problem as most of the objects&#39; colours are black, therefore changing the RBG values. Therefore, this idea will only correctly classify the rubbish/recycling in certain light levels, and therefore would need to be applied in a place such as a mall with constant artificial light levels.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Recycling robots [10] presents the idea of using robots, like those on assembly lines, to identify and pick out the rubbish contaminated in the recycling. In this idea, the robots are placed along conveyor belts, and a machine learning model is then used to identify the rubbish contamination, which is subsequently removed from the belt.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">From the article, there have been real-world implementations of devices such as this. For example, waste management, a company in the USA, has been testing the technology since 2017. A system that has been set up has allowed 850 tons of single-stream material to be processed daily. The company is also looking to set more up, showing that the use of the technology is both economic and viable in the real world.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">This approach would be excellent when supplemented with other ideas discussed here. For example, removing contamination at the level when a person throws it away and at the recycling facility should allow the capture of most of the contamination. This idea also has the added benefit of not needing a significant change in the waste management infrastructure. Robots need to be attached to a conveyer belt, meaning there is no need to redesign entire factories to implement this idea.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part12.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Dissertation%20-%20html.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part14.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
