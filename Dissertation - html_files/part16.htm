Within this project, the data needed are images that can be used to train a model and test the results from that model. Ideally, the data collected for this project would be produced by attaching a camera system to a truck as it makes its recycling run. However, after months of trying and failing to access the needed images, a new different set was used.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Training the model requires many sample images, which allows the model to analyse multiple different scenarios and extract the relevant features. Within this project, the training images came from the trashnet project [43], in which a single piece of recycling or rubbish was laid on a white background and an image was taken in figure 1.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="319" height="239" alt="image" src="Image_001.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Figure 1: Example of an image used for training</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Testing the results from the trained model required a different set of images, as the single images did not represent the real-world use case this project was trying to solve. A recycling bin was emptied onto a garage floor, and pieces of rubbish were added to specific images, as shown in figure 2. Once an image had been taken, the recycling and rubbish were shifted around to create a new image. Collecting the test data allowed the results to reflect a more real-world scenario.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="319" height="399" alt="image" src="Image_002.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figure 2: Example of test images</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part15.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Dissertation%20-%20html.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part17.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
