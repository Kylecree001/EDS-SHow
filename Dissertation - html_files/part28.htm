The project followed a machine learning workflow where first, the images were collected and labelled. Next, those images were used to train different models, testing the model and recording the results. Unfortunately, due to circumstances, the wanted images, which were initially planned to be from a recycling truck, were unobtainable, and therefore other images needed to be used. This caused the training and test images to differ, affecting the results.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Although  the  accuracy  was  not the  highest,  this dissertation  does  produce  some  valuable information about the topic. First, the images required for this project do need to be collected from a real-world environment to produce better results. However, results aside, this dissertation presents a relevant way to label, train and test this idea. Considering how different the training and test data sets were, the results show that image segmentation is a suitable technique that should produce good results with the right tools.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part29.htm">I: World Effects</a><a class="toc0" href="part30.htm">II: Future Work and Recommendations</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part27.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Dissertation%20-%20html.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part29.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
