There are ways to recycle plastic, however, most of the time it turns into either lower quality plastic or can not be used at all and therefore needs to be thrown in the landfill. To combat these several papers have discussed the idea of using machine learning to separate the different types of plastic, allowing for a better quality of plastic once recycled. A successful implementation would greatly reduce the amount of plastic that ends up in the landfill and therefore help reduce the largest part of the waste.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Classification of Black Plastics Waste Using Fluorescence Imaging and Machine Learning [14] suggests using machine learning to help identify the type of plastic when recycling, allowing the plastics that are recycled to be of a higher quality. Currently plastic does not have a high recycling rate and the plastic that does get recycled is usually of lower quality and therefore has fewer applications.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Throughout the year different processes have tried to fix this including hyperspectral imaging in the near-infrared range and X-ray fluorescence. However, these processes have at least some problems when it comes to sorting the quality of plastics. Therefore, the use of machine learning is proposed. The proposed machine learning would happen after the plastics have gone through a grind stage and are in particle size pieces. The machine learning model would then classify the particles on their quality and sort them.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The paper shows that there is a promise for the application, specifically for black plastics which have a problem in the other forms of recognition. Black plastics are largely created from construction sites and allowing the recycling of these plastics to be to a higher level would be a large boost to recycling in a commercial environment.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part44.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Dissertation%20-%20html.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part46.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
