In this idea, the robots are placed along conveyor belts, and a machine learning model is then used to identify the rubbish contamination, which is subsequently removed from the belt.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">From the article, there has been real-world implementation of devices such as this. Waste management, a company in the USA has been testing the technology since 2017. A system that has been set up has allowed for 850 tons of single-stream material to be processed each day. The company is also looking to set more up, showing that the use of the technology is both economical and viable in the real world.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">This approach would be very good when supplemented with some of the other ideas discussed here. By removing contamination at the level when a person throws it away as well as at the recycling facility should allow the capture of the majority of the contamination. As well this idea has the added benefit of not needing a large change in the infrastructure of waste management as robots need to be attached to a conveyer belt meaning there is no need to redesign entire factories to implement this idea.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part42.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Dissertation%20-%20html.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part44.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
