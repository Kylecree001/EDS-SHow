This solution Is used in papers such as Automatic Classification Bin Based on Artificial Intelligent Technology [1], Machine vision-based design of human-machine interactive waste bins for shopping mall areas [2], and Smart mobile robot system for rubbish collection [3]. The basis of the idea is that an item will be input to the system, which will then use machine learning to determine what that item is. The system will then take the item and sort it into the corresponding bin based on the classification.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Although the sorting idea has some merit there are also some problems in the design. One such problem is that when the sorting design is used it spits the size of the bin up into smaller internal bins. Therefore, you now have four or more bins of equal size inside. The problem becomes that different types of rubbish/recycling are consumed at different rates, and therefore one bin will need to be emptied before the others. Since with the current collection method, it will not be possible to collect the bins with a truck a user would now need to manually empty the full part of the bin creating more work.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Sorting at the level of the consumer has another problem with the classification of the item input. If the user inputs two items into the bin, the bin can classify those items, however, since the items are sorted based on the classification, if the items are of two different types of recycling, they both end up in the classified bin. This would mean that contamination would still occur. The results would be better than they are currently as this miss classification caused by two items will happen infrequently, but leaves room for improvement.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Another issue to consider with a sorting aspect is the number of different types of recycling that there are. Currently, there is paper/cardboard, plastics, glass, metals, and rubbish. This would mean that five different containers would be needed inside the bin, which would again lead to more emptying. As well as this the process of emptying and collecting the rubbish would be a lot more difficult. Instead of having one bin for rubbish and one for all other recycling, now 5 different bins need to be emptied and separated. This would both mean more work for the user.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Although in theory sorting the rubbish at the level of it entering the bin is a good idea, in reality, it would mean a lot more work as well as a significant change to the current infrastructure of the rubbish collection system. On top of this practical issues such as how the power is handled, and maintenance needed for the device need to be considered in future designs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part39.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Dissertation%20-%20html.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part41.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
