One of the most precious elements of Earth is the environment, as it supplies the world with the resources needed to survive and thrive. However, as seen through research and discovery, many practices and processes in the modern world pollute and destroy the environment. Research is carried out worldwide to determine possible ways to fix these processes and reduce the damage done by humanity. Recycling is a process that takes certain used materials and turns them back into valuable materials. This process reduces the impact on the environment due to both needing to extract and dispose of fewer raw materials. However, there are problems with the current implementation of this process, as it is estimated that up to 72% of New Zealand recycling [40] ends up in landfills. The cause of all this useful recycling ending up in landfills is rubbish mixing in with the recycling and therefore being unable to be processed. This dissertation explores using machine learning to detect rubbish contamination within recycling. A model was first trained with images of recycling and rubbish; this model was then used to run predictions against a real-world scenario. The process outlined in this dissertation showed that the model created was not very accurate. However, it does build a solid foundation to research further the idea based on the techniques used. Discussing the main reasons the model was not as accurate as wanted and how to address the problems leaves a good starting point to continue this research. Overall, a successful model would reduce wasted recycling and, therefore, help reduce the environmental pollution caused by the extraction and disposal of raw materials.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part3.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Dissertation%20-%20html.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part5.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
